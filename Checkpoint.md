## TODO

1. Install virtualbox through the Dockerfile
2. Configure the .conf files of Cuckoo
3. Build the [Per-Analysis Network Routing](https://cuckoo.sh/docs/installation/host/routing.html#per-analysis-network-routing)
4. [Preparing the guest](https://cuckoo.sh/docs/installation/guest/index.html#preparing-the-guest)
    * Create a virtualbox image inside a windows machine
    * Set-up the image as per the directives of the cuckoo
    * Once the image is completely set-up, download the image.
    * Use the same image to load into the docker through the dockerfile using `vboxmanage` commands.
